`vince` is a self hosted web analytics server that is privacy frivacy friendly and very easy deploy and operate.

We created vince because existing solutions didn't cater to our needs, we needed a feature rich, lightweight and easy to manage alternative to google analytics. Solution like Plausible Analytics already exist but they fall short on easy to manage requirement as a result vince was born.

We offer very similar features like Plausible Analytics in  a single binary that is highly optimized for efficiency to ensure you get the most out of your limited budget.
